Where energy is stored in living organisms,Chemical Bonds
Happen when chemical bonds are broken and energy is released,Exothermic Reactions
The universal energy currency of cells,ATP
Happen when chemical bonds are formed and energy is consumed,Endothermic Reactions
The required energy to start a chemical reaction,Activation Energy
